CME3207, Fall 2018, Lab Assignment 1

Due: 5 Dec 2018, 23:30
Task: Write a MATLAB function that will perform the transformation x[n] to Ax[Bn+C]. Note that A
corresponds to scaling, B to stretching/shrinking and C to time shift. The function name and parameters
must be as follows:
[n,y] = myTransform(x,A,B,C);
Where x is the original discrete function, a 1D matrix(vector) with more than 25 elements. You can use
your own x function for testing, but the function must work for any x larger than 25 elements. A can be
double, but B and C must be integers. The new index vector is n.
Example: To find y = 2.5x[2n+3] we write [n,y] = myTransform(x,2.5,2,3).
Of course y must be the result with all the transformations applied and should plot the result with axes
arranged properly. You can specify a new index variable n which will form the indices of y.
The function must also plot the original function x(top) and y(bottom) in a 2-row 1-col grid with stem()
function with a LineWidth of 2.
You must upload your single .m file to classroom. No zip, rar,7zip, etc!

ÔÅÜYou must have completed upload by December 5th 2018, you will Show your work in lab hour in
December 7th, 2018.
